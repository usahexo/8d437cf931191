#  Sevilla FC Claims Championship in Thrilling Victory Over Real Betis

In a hotly contested match-up, Sevilla FC managed to come out on top against Real Betis, clinching the title of Champion for the 2017-2018 season.

Both sides played aggressively from the beginning, with several scoring opportunities in the first few minutes. It wasn’t until the 27th minute that Sevilla finally broke through, with a goal by Wissam Ben Yedder.

The second half saw an equally intense back-and-forth battle, with both teams fighting hard for control of the ball. In the end, it was Sevilla who prevailed, managing to score two more goals and win the match 3-1.

This victory marks an incredible accomplishment for Sevilla FC and its fans, and cements their place as one of the top soccer clubs in Europe. We can’t wait to see what they’ll achieve next!

#  Nevada Sportsbooks Lose $11.4 Million on NCAA Tournament

Nevada sportsbooks lost $11.4 million on the NCAA Tournament, according to numbers from the state’s Gaming Control Board. That’s the most money sportsbooks have lost on any sporting event in state history.

The reason for the big loss was largely due to missed bets by bettors. Nevada sportsbooks only won $1.16 million on college basketball futures, meaning they lost more than 10 times what they made on bets placed before the tournament began.

In addition to futures bets, casinos also lost money on point spreads and game totals. The only thing that saved them from an even bigger loss was parlay cards, which went slightly into the black with a gain of $200,000.

The previous record for money lost on a sporting event was set in January when sportsbooks lost $10.9 million on NFL games. That number is likely to be shattered this weekend when bettors wager millions of dollars on the Super Bowl.

#  New Jersey Authorizes Sports Gambling in Casinos and at Tracks

Sports gambling has come to New Jersey after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the state on Monday. Casinos and racetracks will now be able to offer sports betting, but there are some restrictions.

Governor Phil Murphy, a Democrat, signed the bill into law hours after the court’s decision was announced. New Jersey had been fighting for the right to offer sports betting since 1992, when a federal ban was enacted. The court’s ruling struck down that ban, allowing states to regulate and tax sports betting as they see fit.

Murphy said that the new law would bring “hundreds of millions of dollars” in revenue to the state each year. He also predicted that it would create thousands of jobs in the Garden State.

Not everyone is happy with the new law, however. The NFL, NCAA, and other professional sports leagues have argued that sports gambling could lead to game-fixing and other corruption. They are now considering whether to challenge New Jersey’s law in court.

In order to bet on a sporting event, New Jersey residents will need to go to a casino or racetrack. They will then be able to place bets on games both live and online. Bets can range from who will win a game or match, to how many points one team will win by or whether there will be a tie.

New Jersey is not the only state considering legalizing sports gambling. Lawmakers in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Mississippi are also looking into it.

# 5. Delaware Online Sports Betting Coming Soon

Delaware could have regulated sports betting before the end of June, if state lawmakers can pass a bill in the coming weeks.

Gov. John Carney said he supports a bill sponsored by Rep. Helene Keeley that would legalize and regulate sports betting in the state. The Delaware Lottery would oversee sports betting, with casinos and racetracks also offering it.

Keeley estimated that regulated sports betting in Delaware could bring in more than $7 million in its first year, with $3 million of that going to the state education fund. That’s on top of the $2 million or so Delaware already makes from legal gambling each year.

The other states that have already legalized sports betting – Nevada, New Jersey and West Virginia – all allow online betting, but it’s not clear yet if Delaware will do the same. Gov. Carney said he wants to see how the regulations work in other states before making a decision on that front.

But given how popular online gambling is in Delaware – there are currently about 260,000 online casino players in the state, according to gaming research company Eilers & Krejcik Gaming – it seems likely that at least some form of online sports betting will be available there soon.

There are still some details to be worked out, such as what kind of bets would be allowed and which sporting events would be covered, but lawmakers expect to have a final bill ready for a vote within the next few weeks.
