#  How To Store Your Betting Records When Rytas Play

The reason to keep records when betting on Rytas games is twofold - analysis and taxation. As long as you can account for every penny you've put towards your Rytas bets, both in terms of winnings and losses, then you're in a much better position should you ever need to prove this to the taxman. Let's take a look at some tips on how to go about it.

 ## The first thing you'll need is some kind of record-keeping system

There are all sorts of software and apps out there that can help with this - from excel spreadsheets to bespoke betting software - but whatever system you choose, it needs to be easy for you to use and update. Make sure that you also back up your data regularly, preferably off-site, in case of computer crashes or other disasters.

## Record each and every bet you make

This may seem like overkill, but even if your overall betting strategy is profitable, individual bets can still go wrong. Recording every bet will help you track your progress (or lack thereof!) and make better decisions in the future. In addition, if something does happen and you have to prove your bets to the authorities, having a detailed record will make things much simpler.

## Keep track of what you wagered and what the outcome was

This is essential not just for taxation purposes but also for analysis. By analysing your results on a granular level, you can start to see which types of bets are working for you and which ones aren't - allowing you to refine your strategy going forwards. You may also find that some specific Rytas players or fixtures are more profitable than others; again, this information will help inform your future betting choices.

## Be consistent with your record-keeping


Whatever system or method you choose for recording your Rytas bets, try to be as consistent as possible. This will make it easier for you to analyse the data in future and discover any trends that may be emerging. Remember that even if your overall betting strategy is profitable, individual bets can still lose money - so it's important to track all aspects of your gambling activity accurately.
