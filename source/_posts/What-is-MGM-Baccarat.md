#  What is MGM Baccarat?

MGM Baccarat is a modern rendition of the casino classic that offers players an exciting and easy-to-learn game experience. The objective of the game is to draw two cards with a point value as close to nine as possible. In MGM Baccarat, the banker always deals the cards and players can bet on who will win, the player or the banker.

# How to Play MGM Baccarat

To begin playing MGM Baccarat, all players must first place a bet on either the player or banker. Once all bets are placed, the banker will deal two cards face up to each player and two cards face down to themselves. The point value of each card is calculated by adding the number on the card together. So, a five and a two would be seven points in total. The highest possible hand is nine points and any hand totalling over ten goes back to zero. If one of the player’s two cards has a point value of eight or nine then they immediately win and their bet is paid out at even money (1:1). If neither player nor banker has an eight or nine then it goes to what is called a “player decision” round.

In this next stage, the player has three choices: they can take another card (hit), stand with their current total or double down for an extra bet in return for one more card only (stay). If the player decides to hit then they draw another card and their new total is calculated. If this new total is still below eight then they have to hit again, but if it equals or beats eight then they stop (stand). At any time during this stage, if either the banker or player has an eight or nine then they immediately end play and their opponent automatically loses irrespective of their own drawn card total. When both players have either eight or nine, or no more cards can be drawn without going over ten, whoever has the higher total wins – just like in blackjack!
