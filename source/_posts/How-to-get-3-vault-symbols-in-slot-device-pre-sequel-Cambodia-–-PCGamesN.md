In Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, you can get 3 vault symbols in slot device pre sequel Cambodia. It’s an Easter egg that was added in the DLC, and it’s pretty tricky to find.

To start, you’ll need to head to the DLC area called “The Secret Armory of General Knoxx”. Once you’re there, go to the map and look for the small island near where you spawn in. The island has a helicopter pad on it, and you can use that to reach the secret area.

Once you’re in the secret area, go ahead and take out the enemies that are waiting for you. Then, enter the building that’s near where you spawned in. Once you’re inside, take out the enemies in that room and go up the stairs.

At the top of the stairs, go into the next room and take out the enemies there. Once they’re dead, look up at the ceiling and shoot the symbol that’s up there. Then, exit this room and go into the next one.

In this room, take out all of the enemies and then crouch down next to where they were standing. There should be a small hole in the ground that you can crawl through. Crawl through it and then keep going until you reach a cave-like area.

Once you reach this area, follow it until you reach a dead end. There will be 3 symbols on the wall here – shoot them all and then enter “vault3″ as your code word to unlock it!

The Vault symbol in pre-sequel Cambodia is a bit different from the one in the main game. The steps for getting it are:

1) Reach the final area of the stage by defeating all enemies on the bridge and platform above it.

2) Use Jack’s action skill to break the glass ceiling, revealing a hidden room.

3) Travel to the bottom of the room and interact with the slot device to get your Vault symbol.

 Tips: This can be done on any character, but Jack has a &quot;power slam&quot; ability that makes it easier. You can also use grenades or other explosive projectiles to break the glass.
