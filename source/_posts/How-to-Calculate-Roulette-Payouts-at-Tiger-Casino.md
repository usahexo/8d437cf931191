#  How to Calculate Roulette Payouts at Tiger Casino

Tiger Casino’s roulette tables are popular with online gamers from around the world. If you’re new to playing roulette, there may be some questions about how the payouts and odds work. This guide will explain how to calculate roulette payouts at Tiger Casino.

To begin with, let’s take a look at the different types of wagers that can be placed on a roulette table:

-Straight up bet: A bet on a single number
-Split bet: A bet on two adjacent numbers on the betting layout
-Street bet: A bet on three consecutive numbers in a row on the betting layout 
-Corner bet: A bet on four adjacent numbers that form a square on the betting layout 
-Six line bet: A bet on six consecutive numbers across two rows on the betting layout 
-Dozen bets: A bet on one of three groups of twelve numbers (1 to 12, 13 to 24, 25 to 36) 
-Column bets: A bet on one of three columns of twelve numbers (1 to 12, 13 to 24, 25 to 36)

After selecting which type of wager you want to make, you then need to place your chips or tokens on the corresponding spot on the betting layout. You can also place multiple bets at once by placing your chips or tokens in different spots; this is known as ‘multi-wagering’. Just be aware that if your winning bets net more than your original stake, you won’t get paid out beyond your initial investment!

Now that we know how to place our bets, let’s take a look at the possible outcomes and how much we can expect to win (or lose!) depending on our selection. In European Roulette – which is the game played at Tiger Casino – there are 37 possible outcomes when the ball lands in one of the numbered slots: 18 black slots and 18 red slots, plus a green slot labelled 0. The following table shows all of the possible outcomes, along with their corresponding payouts and odds ratios:



	 Bet 	 Outcome 	 Payout 	 Odds ratio



	Straight up 	 Single number hit 	 35 : 1 	 2.86%



	Split 	 Two adjacent number hits 	 17 : 1 	 5.41%



	Street 	 Three consecutive number hits 	 11 : 1 	 8.11%


>Corner 	 Four adjacent number hits forming square 	 8 : 1 	 10.53%



	Six line / Double street* 	 Six consecutive number hits across two rows* 	 5 : 1 	 16.22%



#  How to Play Roulette and Get the Best Odds at Tiger Casino

There are a lot of casino games available online, but one of the most popular is roulette. If you're looking to play roulette, Tiger Casino is a great option because they offer some of the best odds in the business. In this article, we'll go over how to play roulette and give you a few tips on how to increase your chances of winning.

First, let's take a look at the basic rules of roulette. Roulette is a game that involves betting on which number or set of numbers the ball will land on after it's spun around the wheel. The wheel has 38 slots - 18 red, 18 black, and 2 green (0 and 00). To begin, you place your bet by selecting a chip value and placing it on the table in the area corresponding to the bet you would like to make. There are a variety of bets you can make, including bets on a single number, bets on two numbers (split), bets on three numbers (street), bets on four numbers (square), etc.

Once all the players have placed their bets, the croupier will spin the ball around the wheel in one direction and then spin the wheel in the opposite direction. The ball will eventually fall into one of the slots on the wheel and that number will be declared the winner. If you placed a bet on that number, you win! If not, you lose your bet amount.

Now that you know how to play roulette, here are some tips to help you increase your chances of winning:

- Start with simple bets: When starting out, it's best to stick with simple bets like betting on a single number or splitting pairs. This will help you get comfortable with the game and increase your chances of winning money.

- Use outside bets: Outside bets are bets that cover more than one number at a time. For example, betting on red or black or even or odd are all examples of outside bets. These types of bets have better odds than inside bets (which cover only one number) so they're a safer way to play.

- Watch the wheel and ball: One key to increasing your chances of winning is watching how the wheel and ball behave as they spin around. This will help you determine where the ball is most likely to end up and accordingly place your bet for maximum odds.

- Avoid placing large bets: It's easy to get carried away when playing roulette and want to place large wagers in an attempt to win big money fast. However, this is not advisable as your chances of losing big are high too. Instead, start small with modest wagers and then increase them as you gain more experience with the game.

#  Learn How to Properly Calulate Roulette Payouts at Tiger Casino

In roulette, there are a variety of bets that can be made on the table. These bets all have different payout odds, and it's important to be familiar with these odds before playing the game. Here we'll take a closer look at how to properly calculate roulette payouts.

There are two types of bets in roulette - inside bets and outside bets. The inside bets are those placed on the numbered grid on the table, while outside bets are placed on the betting area surrounding the grid. The payout odds for each type of bet vary, so it's important to understand which ones offer the best odds.

The most common inside bet is the Straight Up bet, which is a bet on a single number. This bet pays out at 35 to 1, meaning that the player receives 35 times their original bet amount when they win. Another common inside bet is the Split Bet, which is a wager on two adjacent numbers. This bet pays out at 17 to 1, so the player would receive 17 times their original bet amount if they won.

The most common outside bet is known as a Red/Black Bet, and it's simply a wageron whether or not the next spin will result in a red or black number being landed. This bet pays out at 1 to 1, meaning that players who win receive back their original bet amount plus an additional one. Other popular outside bets include Even/Odd and High/Low wagers.

Before placing any bets, it's important to understand how to calculate roulette payouts so that you know what your potential winnings could be. By knowing the odds for each type of bet, you can make more informed choices about where to place your money - and hopefully walk away with some profits!
