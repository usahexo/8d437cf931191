#  DraftKings Sports Betting is Now Legal in These Five States

DraftKings Sports Betting is now legal in Arizona, Nevada, New Jersey, Delaware, and West Virginia. Residents in these states can now legally place sports bets on-site and online with DraftKings Sportsbook.

For those who are unaware, DraftKings is a daily fantasy sports (DFS) company that was founded in 2012. The company allows users to compete in contests for cash prizes by drafting teams of professional athletes.

Now that sports betting is legal in the U.S., DraftKings has decided to expand its business model to include full-scale sports betting. The company has already launched its Sportsbook app in the five aforementioned states, and it will soon be available in additional states.

One of the benefits of using DraftKings Sportsbook is that you can bet on a variety of different sporting events. This includes popular sports such as football, basketball, baseball, and hockey, as well as less popular sports such as cricket and rugby.

In addition to traditional betting options, DraftKings Sportsbook also offers live betting. This allows you to bet on games as they are happening instead of waiting until the end of the game.

There are also a number of bonuses and promotions available through DraftKings Sportsbook. These include sign-up bonuses, reload bonuses, and exclusive promotions for existing customers.

#  DraftKings Approved for Sports Betting in 35 States

DraftKings, the Boston-based fantasy sports company, announced on Thursday that it has received approval from state gaming regulators in 35 states to offer sports betting.

The landmark approvals come as DraftKings ramps up its preparations for a potential launch of sports betting later this year. The company has been active in acquiring other businesses related to sports betting, including data provider Sportradar and social media platform Betfair.

Jason Robins, CEO and co-founder of DraftKings, said in a statement: "Receiving approval in 35 states is a major accomplishment and underscores our commitment to making DraftKings the most popular destination for legal sports betting across the country. We are confident that our experience in launching and operating successful daily fantasy products will translate well into creating exciting sports betting experiences for our customers."
