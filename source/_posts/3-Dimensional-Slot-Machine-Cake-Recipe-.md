#  How to make a Slot Machine Cake 

Making a Slot Machine Cake is easier than you might think!

1. Begin by baking two 9-inch round cake layers.

2. Once the cake layers are cool, use a serrated knife to Level the cakes.

3. Place one cake layer on a serving plate or cake stand.

4. Frost the top of the cake layer with a thin layer of frosting (this is called the "crumb coat").

5. Place the other cake layer on top of the first, and frost the entire cake with a thicker layer of frosting.

6. Use an offset spatula to create a smooth finish. If desired, pipe frosting around the edge of the cake to create a border.

7. For the Slot Machine decoration, start by printing out an image of a slot machine online (you can find many images online by doing a quick Google search). Cut out the image and place it on top of the cake.

8. Use toothpicks to secure the image to the cake. You may need to trim some of the image so that it fit properly on top of the cake.

9. Next, use candy melts or chocolate chips to create the slots on top of the cake (you can find many tutorials online for how to do this). To make it easy, you can use a template like this one: https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Slot-Machine-Cake#slots_.28Template._29 . Start by melting your candy melts or chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl or in a saucepan over low heat, stirring occasionally until melted and smooth. Then pour it into a small ziplock baggie and cut off one corner of the baggie (making sure that you cut off enough so that there is a very small hole). Pipe the melted candy or chocolate onto the template, making sure to cover all of the slots entirely. Repeat this process until all of the slots are filled in. Allow the slots to harden completely before moving on to step 10. 
If desired, you can also add some edible glitter or sprinkles to make it look like casino lights! 
10 Finally, cut some thin strips of black licorice and attach them around the edge of cake slices using icing or melted chocolate as "glue". Serve and enjoy!

#  Create a 3-Dimensional Slot Machine Cake 

This tutorial will show you how to make a 3-dimensional slot machine cake. It is a fun and festive cake that is perfect for any occasion!

To get started, you will need the following supplies: 

-One 9-inch round chocolate cake layer 
-One 9-inch round white cake layer 
-One container of chocolate frosting 
-One container of white frosting 
-Food coloring (green, yellow, red) 
-Black licorice strings 
-Candy canes 

1. Make the three dimensional slot machine cake by first putting the chocolate cake layer on the bottom. Then put the white cake layer on top of that. This will be your base.
2. Frost the outside of the cake with the chocolate frosting. Be sure to spread it evenly. You can use a spatula or a spoon for this. Once it is all covered, set it in the fridge to chill for about 30 minutes.
3. While the cake is chilling, mix together some green food coloring with some of the chocolate frosting. You want it to be a light green color. Set this aside for later.
4. Take the cake out of the fridge and start frosting the top with white frosting. You can use a spatula or a spoon for this as well. Once it is all covered, set it in the fridge again to chill for another 30 minutes.
5. Now it is time to decorate! Start by taking some black licorice strings and cutting them into small pieces. These will be your levers and gears on the slot machine cake. Place them around the edge of the cake, sticking them into the frosting so they stay in place. 
6. Next, take some candy canes and break them into small pieces as well. These will be your coins on the slot machine cake. Place them sporadically around the edge of the cake as well, sticking them into the frosting so they stay in place.

Making a slot machine cake is a fun and easy project that can be completed by anyone with basic baking skills. This guide will walk you through the steps necessary to make your own slot machine cake, including tips on how to create the illusion of spinning reels.

To get started, you will need a 9-inch round cake pan, two batches of your favorite cake recipe, green frosting, brown frosting, and black licorice. The green frosting will be used for the sides and top of the cake, while the brown frosting will be used for the gambling symbols on the front of the machine.

The first step is to bake your cake. Once it is cooled, use a serrated knife to cut it in half horizontally so that you have two layers. Next, frost the bottom layer with green frosting and set the second layer on top. Frost the entire cake with green frosting, making sure to smooth it out evenly.

Now it's time to add the gambling symbols. Use a small offset spatula to spread brown frosting over the top of the cake in fourteen equal sections. Then use a toothpick or sharp knife to draw lines between each section, creating a grid pattern. Finally, use black licorice to create the slots on each section.

Your slot machine cake is now finished! Serve it at your next party or celebration and enjoy watching everyone's reaction when they see how it actually works!
