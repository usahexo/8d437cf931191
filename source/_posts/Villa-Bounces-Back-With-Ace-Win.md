#  Villa Bounces Back With Ace Win

In what was a must-win game after their two consecutive losses, Villa bounced back emphatically with an ace performance against Stoke City.

The hosts were boosted by the return of talismanic striker Christian Benteke, who made his first start in six weeks and looked lively throughout.

It was Benteke who put Villa ahead after just eight minutes; latching onto a delightful through ball from Andreas Weimann before coolly slotting home.

Weimann himself then doubled Villa’s lead midway through the first half, smashing a ferocious volley past Asmir Begovic into the top corner.

The Austrian had another opportunity to score moments later but saw his lobbed effort bounce agonisingly off the crossbar.

Stoke did pull one back before the break, courtesy of a brilliant 25-yard free-kick from Charlie Adam, but it was only a consolation goal.

Villa continued to dominate after the interval and could have extended their lead on several occasions but were ultimately happy to hold on for the three points.

The win moves Villa up to seventh place in the table, just two points off fourth-placed Liverpool.

#  Villa Scores Early and Often in Ace Victory

Claudio Villa, fresh off his move from Atletico Madrid to AC Milan, wasted little time making an impact with his new club. In a preseason friendly against lowly US Avellino, he netted four goals in the first half en route to a 5-1 victory.

The speedy Villa was too much for the Avellino defenders, as he repeatedly found space in behind them to race onto through balls from the midfield. His first goal came in the 10th minute, when he beat the offside trap and finished calmly past the keeper.

He would score twice more before halftime, completing a well-worked team move in the 29th minute and then finding the bottom corner after being put through by Rui Costa in stoppage time.

Milan manager Fabio Capello was pleased with Villa’s performance, commenting after the game that “he has all of the attributes needed to be a success in Serie A. He’s quick, strong and has an excellent touch. I’m sure he’ll be a key player for us this season.”

The early signs are certainly good for Milan fans and Claudio Villa alike – it looks like he may be well on his way to becoming an AC Milan legend.

#  Aston Villa Runs Away with Ace Game

The Aston Villa team took to the field today with determination and drive. Their opponents, Wolverhampton Wanderers, put up a good fight, but in the end Aston Villa's superior play won out.

The first goal of the match came early, with Aston Villa scoring in the 8th minute. That goal was quickly followed by another in the 16th minute, putting Aston Villa up 2-0 and effectively taking control of the game.

Wolverhampton Wanderers managed to get one goal back before halftime, but Aston Villa came roaring back in the second half, adding two more goals to their tally and winning the game 4-1.

This was an impressive victory for Aston Villa and should give them a lot of confidence as they head into the rest of the season.

#  Second Half Surge Leads Villa to an Ace Win

A dominant second-half showing led Aston Villa to a 3-0 victory over Derby County on Saturday.

Villa started the game quickly and got on the scoreboard in the eighth minute when Conor Hourihane blasted home a penalty kick. The home side continued to pressure the Derby defense and doubled their lead in the 33rd minute when Tammy Abraham netted his ninth goal of the season.

Derby had few chances to get back into the game, but Villa sealed the win with a third goal in stoppage time when Abraham set up Jack Grealish for an easy finish.

The victory keeps Villa in second place in the Championship table, just two points behind league-leaders Leeds United.

#  Late Goal Lifts Villa Over Newcastle in Ace Match

Two teams in good form faced off at Villa Park, with Newcastle United the visitors. Villa came into the match having won their last two games, while Newcastle had won four of their last five. It was a hard-fought match, but a late goal by Jack Grealish gave Aston Villa the win.

The first half was a relatively even affair, with both sides getting chances. The best opportunity of the half fell to Newcastle’s Miguel Almiron, who hit the post after great work from Allan Saint-Maximin down the right wing.

After halftime, it was more of the same as both teams continued to create chances. And it was Newcastle who took the lead in the 68th minute through Ayoze Perez. The Spaniard finished emphatically after a through ball from Matt Ritchie put him through on goal.

But Villa were not done yet. In the 86th minute, substitute Grealish got on the end of a cross from Ahmed Elmohamady to head home and equalize for his side. And then, in stoppage time, he struck again to give Villa all three points. It was an impressive finish from Grealish and capped off an excellent all-around performance from Aston Villa.

This result moves Villa up to seventh in the Premier League table, just one point behind sixth-place Manchester United. Newcastle are still in ninth place but have now fallen six points behind seventh-place Wolves.
