But it's not just about branding. Unibet also stands to make quite a bit of money from this partnership.

Only time will tell.

#  What are your thoughts on FC Barcelona's sponsorship deal with Unibet?

FC Barcelona's sponsorship deal with Unibet has sparked a lot of controversy since it was announced in early 2018. Some people argue that the club is endorsing gambling and promoting a dangerous activity, while others claim that the deal is a financial necessity for Barcelona in the current economic climate.

Let's take a closer look at the deal and what it means for both FC Barcelona and Unibet. The agreement is reportedly worth £57 million over four years, making it one of the most lucrative sponsorship deals in football. Unibet will become the official betting partner of FC Barcelona, and will have exclusive rights to use the club's logo and trademarks.

So what are Unibet's plans for this partnership? Well, they intend to use FC Barcelona as a vehicle to promote their brand globally. They hope to tap into the millions of fans of the club who live all over the world. In addition, they plan to use the deal to attract new customers and increase their market share.

For FC Barcelona, this deal is a way to bring in some much-needed extra revenue. The club has been struggling financially in recent years, due in part to disappointing performances on the pitch and questionable investment decisions by its owners. This sponsorship deal will help to ease some of that financial pressure.

So what do fans think of this agreement? There has been a mixed reaction, with some people arguing that Barça should not be teaming up with an online bookmaker. Others, however, see it as a sensible business decision by the club and are happy that they are trying to bring in more money through sponsorships.

In conclusion, there are pros and cons to FC Barcelona's sponsorship deal with Unibet. On one hand, some people feel uncomfortable about an online bookmaker being associated with such a prestigious club like Barça. On the other hand, this deal could help to revive FC Barcelona's finances and improve their global reach.
