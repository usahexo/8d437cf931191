Sleepy period down south casino
The Blaugranas have added the Copa Del Rey to their La Liga trophy, sealing a double for the second consecutive season. A 2-1 victory over Sevilla at the Wanda Metropolitano was enough to see Barça crowned champions of Spain for the 26th time.

The first goal of the match came from an unlikely source, as Sergi Roberto met Jordi Alba’s cross with a deft header in the 36th minute. Sevilla equalized shortly after the break through Pablo Sarabia, but Lionel Messi put Barça back in front with a delicate chip over goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik in the 68th minute.

It was a record-equaling 33rd Copa Del Rey title for Barça, and Ernesto Valverde’s side are now just one championship away from matching Real Madrid’s total of 34. As well as La Liga and Copa glory, Valverde has also won the Spanish Super Cup and UEFA Champions League in his first two years at Camp Nou.

#  MSN trio fire Barça to Copa glory

A triumphant MSN trio fired Barcelona to a 5-1 victory over Alaves in the Copa del Rey final on Saturday, as the Catalans reclaimed the trophy they last won in 2015.

Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar were in irresistible form at the Vicente Calderon Stadium in Madrid, scoring two goals each to give Barca their 27th Copa crown.

Messi swept home a penalty after Neymar had been chopped down by Victor Laguardia midway through the first half. Suarez then made it 2-0 with a clinical finish after a superb team move.

Alaves pulled one back before halftime through Theo Hernandez, but any hopes of an upset were extinguished within seven minutes of the restart as Neymar and Suarez both struck.

The world’s most expensive player then completed his brace with a delicate chip over Fernando Pacheco after being put through by Messi, who finished the night with his 38th goal of the season.

“It was an intense match, very hard fought. They made it difficult for us in the first half, but we stepped up our intensity in the second and took control,” said Barcelona coach Luis Enrique.

#  Neymar nets twice as Barcelona cruise to Copa final

Neymar netted twice as Barcelona eased to a 3-0 victory over Alaves in the Copa del Rey final on Saturday, lifting the trophy for the fifth time in his career.

Lionel Messi opened the scoring with a clever free-kick midway through the first half, before Neymar made it 2-0 early in the second period with a well-taken finish.

And Neymar completed his brace late on, firing into the bottom corner after being played in by Paco Alcacer to seal an emphatic victory for Barca.

The win means that Luis Enrique's side complete an unprecedented La Liga and Copa double, having also triumphed in Spain's top flight this season.

After accepting the trophy from King Felipe VI, Enrique paid tribute to his players and announced he will leave the club at the end of the season.

“These players have made me very happy. I am leaving, but I will always be here to see them win titles," said Enrique.

Elsewhere, Atletico Madrid capped off their disappointing season by beating Real Madrid 2-1 in Saturday's other cup final.

#  Suárez at the double as Barcelona ease into Copa final

Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez both scored twice as Barcelona eased into the Copa del Rey final with a 5-0 win over Sevilla on Wednesday.

With the La Liga title all but secured, Barça coach Ernesto Valverde could afford the luxury of resting several first-team regulars, including Andres Iniesta and Gerard Piqué. However, the likes of Neymar, Jordi Alba and Suárez still proved too much for Sevilla to handle.

Suárez opened the scoring in the 27th minute, tapping in from close range after Neymar’s shot had been saved by David Soria. The Uruguayan striker then doubled his tally six minutes later, firing low past Soria from just inside the penalty area.

Messi made it 3-0 early in the second half, curling a sublime free-kick into the top corner from 25 yards out. And Neymar added Barça’s fourth in the 68th minute, slotting home after another one-on-one with Soria.

Suárez completed his hat-trick in stoppage time, volleying in from close range after a cross from Sergi Roberto. The 5-0 victory means that Barcelona will face Alavés in the final on 27 May.

#  Iniesta and Busquets lead way as Barça march into Copa final

It might not have been the most exciting of games, but FC Barcelona advanced to their fourth consecutive Copa del Rey final with a 2-0 victory over Valencia on Wednesday. With the likes of Andrés Iniesta and Sergio Busquets in the team, it's no wonder they have such a good record in this competition – they know how to get the job done.

Iniesta has enjoyed a resurgence in form in recent weeks, and he was once again at his best against Valencia. The midfielder opened the scoring midway through the first half with a trademark curling effort from outside the penalty area, and he was unlucky not to add a second before half-time. Busquets was also impressive, anchoring midfield and winning plenty of tackles.

Valencia posed little threat for most of the game, but they did come close to equalising towards the end of the second half. However, Marc-Andre ter Stegen made a good save to deny them, and Barça eventually sealed their place in the final with a late goal from Paco Alcácer.

There are still some doubts about Barça ahead of next month's final against Sevilla. They were far from their best against Valencia, and there are concerns about how they will cope without Neymar following his transfer to Paris Saint-Germain. However, they have a lot of quality in their squad and should be favourites to win the cup once again.
