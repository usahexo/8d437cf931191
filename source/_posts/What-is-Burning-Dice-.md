# What is Burning Dice? 

Burning Dice is a new, innovative way of playing casino games that is quickly gaining in popularity. It is a platform that allows players to bet on the outcome of random number generators (RNGs) using blockchain technology.

Burning Dice is built on the Ethereum network and uses smart contracts to ensure fairness and security. Players can bet on a variety of casino games, including blackjack, roulette, and poker.

One of the key benefits of Burning Dice is that it allows players to bet on multiple games at once. This makes it a great platform for those who like to spread their bets across different games. 

Another benefit of Burning Dice is that it offers instant payouts. There is no need to wait for funds to be transferred from one account to another – payouts are made immediately once the result of the game has been confirmed. 

Burning Dice also offers transparency and security. All transactions are logged on the blockchain and cannot be altered or tampered with. This ensures that players can trust the platform and know that their funds are safe.

# What is the Burning Dice Game? 

The Burning Dice Game is a game that is believed to have originated in the Orient. It is a gambling game in which players bet on the result of rolling two dice. The game can be played by any number of players, but it is usually best with four or five. 

The game is played in rounds. In each round, each player rolls the dice and compares the total shown to that of the other players. The player with the highest total wins the round and collects all of the stakes from the other players. If two or more players have the same total, they share the pot equally. 

The player who wins the most rounds wins the game. 

# How to Play 

To begin, each player places an equal amount of money (or chips) in the pot. The dealer then gives each player two dice, and each player rolls them privately. After all players have rolled, the totals are compared and the highest total (sum of both dice) wins the round. If there is a tie, as long as it’s not for first place, those players split the pot evenly. If there’s a tie for first place, then it goes back to another round to determine a winner(s). The winner(s) takes possession of all current bets on that particular table or court (in some variants). 

Players can either continue betting on subsequent rounds or drop out of play; should all players except one drop out, then said one player automatically claims victory with predetermined stakes going to him or her automatically (such as doubling their buy-in). In variants where an ante is used, this rule generally holds with exception that if only two people are left playing “against” one another - these two people must either agree to bet mutually what would be an ante at this stage OR put up whatever stakes they had prior when 3+ people were playing; if playing Pot Limit Omaha Hi-Lo among others), and/or go onto multiple tables - first person eliminated from any given table moves their buy-in onto next table until one lone victor remains who takes everything). In some versions 4th street deals are turned face up instead of closed ones being used in common poker games post flop though this does give away what some may deem important information post flop e.g.: whether someone’s hand has improved by getting certain types of cards or whether they are trying to bluff). Like poker variants, most house rules will dictate how ties are broken (and breaking ties tend not to benefit players financially). 

In order to win you must beat every other player sitting at the table!

# Why are dice burning?

Dice are burning because there is a chemical reaction happening between the materials inside the die and the air around it. When you roll a die, the small plastic pieces inside rub against each other, creating heat. This heat can cause the die to burn, especially if there is a lot of friction.

The material that is usually responsible for dice burning is called phosphorus. Phosphorus is used in dice because it makes them glow in the dark. However, this also means that they are more likely to burn.

There are a few things you can do to reduce the chances of your dice burning. One is to store them in a cool, dry place. You can also try coating them with a thin layer of oil or wax. This will help to create a barrier between the phosphorus and the air, and will reduce the amount of heat that is generated when the dice are rolled.
