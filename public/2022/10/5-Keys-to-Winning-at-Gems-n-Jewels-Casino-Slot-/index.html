Here are the five key principles for getting the most out of Gems n Jewels casino slot:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose the right machine. Not all slot machines are created equal – some offer better odds than others. Do your research ahead of time and find the best machine to play on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bet low, bet often. Many players make the mistake of betting high amounts at a time, thinking that they’ll win more money this way. However, it’s actually smarter to bet low amounts often – this way you can make more spins overall and have a higher chance of winning something.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use your bonus wisely. If you’re lucky enough to get a bonus round, make sure you use it wisely. Some bonus rounds offer great opportunities to win big, while others are more geared towards building your bankroll slowly but surely. Play to your strengths!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Know when to quit. This may be one of the most important tips of all – know when to walk away from the machine! If you’ve been playing for a while and haven’t won anything, it might be time to move on and try your luck elsewhere.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stay calm and collected. Finally, one of the most important things to remember when playing slots is to stay calm and collected. Getting frustrated or angry will only lead to mistakes and lost money. Take your time, enjoy yourself, and you’re much more likely to come out ahead in the end!</p>
</li>

<h1 id="How-to-Win-at-Blackjack-in-Casino-Gems-n-Jewels"><a href="#How-to-Win-at-Blackjack-in-Casino-Gems-n-Jewels" class="headerlink" title="How to Win at Blackjack in Casino Gems n Jewels"></a>How to Win at Blackjack in Casino Gems n Jewels</h1><p>When playing blackjack in Casino Gems n Jewels, it’s important to know the basic rules of the game. You can improve your chances of winning by following a few simple tips.</p>
<p>The object of blackjack is to beat the dealer by either getting 21 points on your first two cards, or by having a higher total than the dealer without going over 21. Aces are worth 1 or 11 points, 2 through 10 are worth face value, and a queen or king is worth 10 points.</p>
<p>You can Hit (draw another card), Stand (end your turn), Double Down (double your bet, and receive one additional card), or Split (split a pair into two separate hands) as you choose. If you go over 21, you Bust and lose the hand.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips to help you win at blackjack:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Don’t over-bet: It’s important not to bet more than you can afford to lose. This will help keep you from losing too much money if you happen to lose a hand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t draw too many cards: When you hit, you increase your chances of going over 21 and busting. If there’s no chance of getting 21 on the next card, it’s usually best to stand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be aware of the dealer’s upcard: The dealer’s upcard tells you how likely it is that he has a good hand. An Ace upcard means the dealer is likely to have 17 or more points, so be careful when deciding whether to hit or stand. A 6 upcard means the dealer is likely to have less than 17 points, so this may be a good time to double down or split if you have two matching cards.</p>
</li>
</ol>

Many casinos offer a variety of games for players to choose from, and one of the most popular is blackjack.</p>
<p>Blackjack is a game that involves betting against the dealer in order to make a hand total of 21 or as close to 21 as possible. The aim is to make decisions that will give you the best chance of winning, and there are some secrets that can help you do just that.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll be taking a look at some of the secrets to winning casino games – specifically blackjack – so read on for all the information you need.</p>

<h1 id="Win-Big-Playing-Casino-Gems-n-Jewels-–-Blackjack-Edition"><a href="#Win-Big-Playing-Casino-Gems-n-Jewels-–-Blackjack-Edition" class="headerlink" title="Win Big Playing Casino Gems n Jewels – Blackjack Edition"></a>Win Big Playing Casino Gems n Jewels – Blackjack Edition</h1><p>Casino Gems n Jewels is one of the most popular casino games. It’s easy to learn and offers plenty of excitement for seasoned players and newcomers alike. In this blackjack edition, we’ll teach you how to play the game and give you some tips on how to win big.</p>
<p>To start, select your bet amount by clicking on the chip denominations at the bottom of the screen. You can bet between 1 and 100 chips on each hand. Once you’ve chosen your bet, click on the table to place your bet.</p>
<p>The dealer will then deal two cards to each player and two cards to themselves – one face up and one face down. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer’s hand total without going over 21.</p>
<p>You can choose to hit (take another card) or stand (stick with your current total). If your hand total exceeds 21, you bust and automatically lose the hand.</p>
<p>The value of each card is as follows: A=1, 2=2, 3=3, 4=4, 5=5, 6=6, 7=7, 8=8, 9=9, 10=10, J=11, Q=12, K=13, A=14). So if you are dealt an Ace and a 2 your total would be 3 (A+2 = 3).</p>
<p>If you want to split your cards (usually only allowed if you are dealt two cards of the same value), click on the ‘split’ button and then place a second bet equal to your original bet amount. You will then be dealt another card for each split card and will play both hands separately.</p>
<p>If you are dealt two cards of the same value (e.g. two Kings), you can choose to double down by placing an additional bet equal to your original bet amount. You will then be dealt just one more card and must stand (ie not hit or split further). Note that if you choose to double down and then bust (go over 21), you lose both bets!</p>
<p>Once all players have finished their turns, the dealer reveals their face-down card. If their total is 16 or less they must hit; if their total is 17 or more they must stand. If they bust (go over 21), all players who have not busted also lose the hand. The highest total wins the hand – so if both player and dealer have bust totals then no one wins!</p>
<p> So now that you know how to play Casino Gems n Jewels Blackjack Edition – let’s take a look at some tips on how to win big!</p>
<pre><code>   Winning Tips for Casino Gems n Jewels Blackjack Edition

 Luck definitely plays a part in any casino game outcome but there are ways that you can tilt those odds in your favor:
</code></pre>
<p>  Start by choosing a reputable online casino . There are many out there but not all offer a fair gaming experience . Make sure the casino has been around for awhile , has good reviews online , offers generous bonuses , fair payout percentages , etc .</p>
<p>When playing Casino Gems n Jewels Blackjack Edition , always remember basic blackjack strategy ! This includes knowing when to hit , stand , split , or double down depending on your hand . For example , if you have a hard 17 (an Ace + 6) it is generally better to stand than hit as the odds of going bust are higher .</p>
<p>Remember that insurance is always a bad bet ! When offered insurance against losing your hand (by making an additional side bet), always refuse as it’s typically a poor decision mathematically speaking .</p>
<p>Look for casinos that offer multiplayer tournaments ! These can be great fun and provide hours of excitement as well as potential profits . Not all casinos offer these multi-player games so do some research before depositing .</p>
<p>Be aware of Gambler’s Ruin ! This is basically the mathematical fact that if you keep playing any casino game long enough , eventually Lady Luck will abandon you and all your funds will be lost . While it may not happen in every session it’s important to keep this in mind so as not go overboard with betting amounts .</p>
<h1 id="Tips-for-Beating-the-House-Edge-in-Casino-Gems-n-Jewels-Blackjack"><a href="#Tips-for-Beating-the-House-Edge-in-Casino-Gems-n-Jewels-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Beating the House Edge in Casino Gems n Jewels Blackjack"></a>Tips for Beating the House Edge in Casino Gems n Jewels Blackjack</h1><p>Gambling, for many people, is a form of entertainment. They go to casinos to try their luck, have some fun, and maybe walk away with a bit of extra money. For others, gambling is a serious business venture. They Rue the day they ever walked into a casino, because they are on a mission to take the house edge down as low as possible. If you are in the latter category, then these tips will help you achieve your goal!</p>
<p>Tip 1: Play blackjack</p>
<p>Blackjack is one of the casino games that offer the best odds for players. In general, casinos have a house edge of around 2-3%. However, in blackjack this edge can be reduced to as low as 0.5%. This is because blackjack is a game that involves both skill and chance. The player has some control over the outcome by making decisions about when to hit or stand, but the dealer also has a role to play. So, while it is not possible to win every time you play, following some basic strategy can help you reduce the house edge substantially.</p>
<p>Tip 2: Use perfect strategy</p>
<p>As mentioned above, blackjack is a game that involves both skill and chance. The player’s skill comes into play by making decisions about when to hit or stand. However, there is also some chance involved, as the dealer also has a role to play. Because of this, it is not possible to win every time you play. However, by using perfect strategy you can reduce the house edge as much as possible. There are different variations of blackjack, so make sure you use perfect strategy for the variation that you are playing.</p>
<p>Tip 3: Avoid risky bets</p>
<p>There are certain bets in blackjack that are more risky than others. These are known as sucker bets and it is best to avoid them altogether if you want to reduce the house edge. Some of these bets include doubling down on 11 (or any other hand), splitting Aces*, and betting on Black or Red at roulette**. While it may be tempting to make these types of bets when you are feeling lucky, they generally offer very poor odds for players. Instead, stick with safer bets which will give you a better chance of winning in the long run.</p>
<ul>
<li>Splitting Aces increases the risk of busting since each Ace becomes two cards totaling 21 points). ** Betting on Black or Red at roulette gives the house an advantage of around 5%.</li>
</ul>
