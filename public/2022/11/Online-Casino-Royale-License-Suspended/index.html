      		<h1 id="Online-Casino-Royale-License-Suspended"><a href="#Online-Casino-Royale-License-Suspended" class="headerlink" title="Online Casino Royale License Suspended"></a>Online Casino Royale License Suspended</h1><p>The Gibraltar gambling commission has temporarily suspended the online casino license of Royale Casino. The suspension is due to the casino’s failure to pay out €6,000 in winnings to a player.</p>
<p>The player, who wishes to remain anonymous, won the money on a game of blackjack. However, when they went to collect their winnings, Royale Casino refused to pay out.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Gibraltar gambling commission said:</p>
<p>“The Gibraltar gambling commission has taken the decision to suspend the remote gambling licence of Royale Casino with immediate effect. This decision has been taken due to the operator’s failure to payout a customer’s winnings.”</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Royale Casino has failed to payout its customers. In fact, this is the fourth time that the casino has been caught withholdings players’ winnings.</p>
<p>In light of these allegations, the Gibraltar gambling commission has urged players not to play at Royale Casino.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Owner-Arrested-for-Gambling-Illegal"><a href="#Casino-Owner-Arrested-for-Gambling-Illegal" class="headerlink" title="Casino Owner Arrested for Gambling Illegal"></a>Casino Owner Arrested for Gambling Illegal</h1><p>The owner of a casino in Atlantic City was arrested on Wednesday for running an illegal gambling operation.</p>
<p>Prosecutors say that the casino owner, who has not been named, ran a gambling ring that took in millions of dollars in bets.</p>
<p>The owner is facing multiple felony charges, including conspiracy and money laundering. He is also accused of failing to pay taxes on the illicit income.</p>
<p>If convicted, he could face up to 20 years in prison.</p>
<p>This is just the latest in a series of arrests made as part of New Jersey’s crackdown on illegal gambling operations. In March, two men were charged with running an illegal sports betting ring out of a pizzeria in Trenton.</p>
<p>And late last year, six people were arrested for operating an underground poker club out of a catering hall in Clifton.</p>
<p>Illegal gambling is big business in New Jersey, and law enforcement officials are cracking down on the operations that have proliferated in recent years. In addition to the arrests made so far, state prosecutors have also seized millions of dollars in assets from various gambling operations.</p>
<h1 id="10-Million-in-Illegal-Gambling-at-Casino-Royale"><a href="#10-Million-in-Illegal-Gambling-at-Casino-Royale" class="headerlink" title="$10 Million in Illegal Gambling at Casino Royale"></a>$10 Million in Illegal Gambling at Casino Royale</h1><p>In what could be a record-breaking gambling bust, $10 million was seized from an illegal high-roller casino at the posh Casino Royale in Macau on Thursday. According to local authorities, most of the gamblers were from mainland China and were using VIP rooms at the casino to place their bets.</p>
<p>Apparently, this isn’t the first time that large sums of money have been wagered at Casino Royale - in fact, it’s estimated that millions of dollars are gambled illegally at the casino every year. Officials say that they plan to crack down on gambling at the casino in an effort to stop criminal activity, but it’s likely that the illicit activities will continue as long as there is big money to be made.</p>
<p>Casino Royale is one of the most popular casinos in Macau, and it’s no secret that high rollers often visit the property to bet large sums of money. In addition to its luxurious facilities and exclusive vibe, Casino Royale also offers some of the loosest slots and highest table limits in town. This makes it a magnet for Chinese gamblers who want to make a quick buck - and it looks like police will have their work cut out for them if they want to shut the casino down.</p>
<h1 id="7-Charged-in-Connection-to-Gambling-Illegality-at-Casino-Royale"><a href="#7-Charged-in-Connection-to-Gambling-Illegality-at-Casino-Royale" class="headerlink" title="7 Charged in Connection to Gambling Illegality at Casino Royale"></a>7 Charged in Connection to Gambling Illegality at Casino Royale</h1><p>Seven people were arrested and charged on March 19 in connection to a gambling operation at Casino Royale. The defendants are all accused of various offenses, including promotion of illegal gambling, criminal conspiracy, and money laundering. </p>
<p>Authorities became aware of the alleged illegal gambling ring after an investigation that began in early 2018. The probe into the illegal activity at Casino Royale reportedly revealed that the casino was being used as a front for a sophisticated crime syndicate that was engaged in money laundering and other serious crimes. </p>
<p>The defendants are all from the Philadelphia area. They include Louis Ferrara, Jr., Anthony Azzaro, Jr., Salvatore Bucci, Michael Colangelo, Angelo J. Frangipane, Dominick Mandarino, Jr., and Ronald Ricciardi. </p>
<p>According to investigators, the defendants were running a high-stakes gambling operation at Casino Royale that involved millions of dollars. They allegedly took bets on sporting events and other games of chance. Prosecutors allege that the defendants laundered the profits from their illegal activities through various businesses they controlled. </p>
<p>All seven of the defendants have been arraigned and are currently awaiting trial. If convicted, they could face up to 40 years in prison.</p>
<h1 id="State-Raids-Casino-Royale-Amidst-Gambling-Allegations"><a href="#State-Raids-Casino-Royale-Amidst-Gambling-Allegations" class="headerlink" title="State Raids Casino Royale Amidst Gambling Allegations"></a>State Raids Casino Royale Amidst Gambling Allegations</h1><p>The state of Nevada conducted a raid at Casino Royale on Tuesday amid allegations that the casino was operating an illegal gambling ring.</p>
<p>Authorities say they seized video machines, computer systems, and records as part of the investigation.</p>
<p>No arrests have been made, but the casino is facing possible penalties including fines and closure.</p>
<p>Casino Royale issued a statement denying any wrongdoing and saying that it would cooperate with authorities in their investigation.</p>
<p>Gambling has been a major source of revenue for the state of Nevada for many years, and officials are not going to let anyone jeopardize that revenue stream.</p>
<p>Casino Royale is just the latest casino to be raided as part of a crackdown on illegal gambling in Nevada.</p>
